Overview:
UberData Insights is a comprehensive project aimed at extracting, transforming, and analyzing Uber ride data. By leveraging modern data engineering techniques and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services such as Mage Pipeline and BigQuery, this project provides valuable insights into Uber's operations.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to enable data-driven decision-making for Uber by analyzing various aspects of ride data, including pick-up/drop-off times, locations, trip distances, fares, and payment types. Through sophisticated data processing and analysis, the project seeks to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can optimize operational efficiency and enhance user experience.

Key Components:

Data Extraction: The project begins with extracting raw Uber ride data from the provided dataset (uber_data.csv). This dataset contains detailed information about Uber trips, including timestamps, locations, passenger counts, fares, and more.

ETL Processing with Mage Pipeline: The extracted data undergoes Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processing using Mage Pipeline. This involves cleaning, transforming, and loading the data into Google BigQuery, ensuring it is in a structured format suitable for analysis.

Data Analysis with BigQuery: The transformed data is analyzed using SQL queries within Google BigQuery. These queries enable various analytical tasks, such as aggregations, filtering, and joining different datasets to derive meaningful insights.

Data Modeling: The project includes dimensional modeling of tables, defining relationships and attributes to facilitate efficient data storage and retrieval. This step enhances the organization and understanding of the data for analysis purposes.

ETL Transformation with Jupyter Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks contain code for further ETL transformation and data analysis. These notebooks provide a flexible and interactive environment for exploring the data, performing additional transformations, and generating visualizations for deeper insights.

Project Execution:
Setup: The setup involves configuring Mage Pipeline, Google Cloud Platform services, and installing necessary dependencies for data processing and analysis.
Execution: Data extraction, transformation, loading, and analysis tasks are executed sequentially according to the defined workflow. Any issues or errors encountered during execution are addressed and resolved to ensure smooth project progression.
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation is maintained throughout the project, detailing the project's objectives, methodologies, workflows, and outcomes. This documentation serves as a valuable resource for project stakeholders, facilitating understanding and collaboration.
